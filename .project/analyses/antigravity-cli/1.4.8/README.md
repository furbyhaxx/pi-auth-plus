# agy 1.4.8 — reverse-engineering dossier

Full decomposition of Google's Antigravity CLI (`agy`) 1.4.8: login, auth, APIs,
quota and reset mechanics, and agent internals. Evidence-backed, written for
reimplementation in this repo's `antigravity` family.

Upstream tracking (pinned version, imitated surface, verification log):
[`../tracking.md`](../tracking.md).

## Ten findings that matter most

1. **Login is manual-paste, not loopback.** Redirect is the remote
   `https://antigravity.google/oauth-callback`; `agy` never opens a socket for the
   consumer flow. A localhost callback will be rejected. (02 §2)
2. **Two OAuth clients, keyed on auth method**, each with an embedded installed-app
   secret: `consumer` and `gcp`. A third client belongs to MCP only. (02 §3)
3. **Quota limits and resets come from `v1internal:retrieveUserQuotaSummary`, not
   `loadCodeAssist`.** Five real buckets across three groups: `gemini-weekly`/`gemini-5h`,
   `3p-weekly`/`3p-5h`, `gemini-argon-wtu-weekly`. **Every group but Argon carries two limits,
   a 5-hour and a weekly one.** (05 §3.2)
4. **Reset is server-authoritative and rolling, not boundary-aligned.** Each bucket's window
   is anchored to its own first use: the two 5-hour buckets reset 4 seconds apart, and nothing
   lines up with midnight or a round hour. An untouched bucket returns `now + window` on every
   read, so its countdown restarts each time you look. (05 §4.1, 03 "Observed live")
5. **`availableCredits` can be a threshold, not a balance.** On the observed account it
   carried only `minimumCreditAmountForUsage: "50"` and no `creditAmount`, so the credit
   balance must render as **unknown**. `remainingFraction` is cost-weighted, never a request
   count. (05 §2.3)
6. **Nothing is called vendor-direct.** Claude goes to Vertex `publishers/anthropic/models/
   {model}:streamRawPredict` in Anthropic wire format with the Google token; GPT-OSS goes
   to Vertex MaaS as `gpt-oss-120b-maas`. (04 §7.3)
7. **The CLI is not the network client.** It spawns a language-server child process on two
   ephemeral loopback ports (gRPC/TLS + HTTP) and drives it over Connect. (01 §3)
8. **Model id encodes the thinking level** (`gemini-4-argon-medium`), and context windows
   are experiment-assigned, not static. (03 §2, §5)
9. **Token storage is session-conditional**: file backend is chosen when an SSH session is
   detected, independently of the keyring-timeout fallback. (07, 02 §6.3)
10. **Permissions are a preset enum** (`REQUEST_REVIEW`, `TURBO`, `VETTED`, `NONE`, `AUTO`,
    …) with per-project grant records, plus a PolicyGuardian vetting layer. (06 §3)

## Reproducing this

The binary is stripped but pclntab survives. One tool does the work:

```bash
T=.project/analyses/antigravity-cli/1.4.8/tools/goresym.py
A=~/.local/bin/agy

python3 $T --bin $A init                        # build the function cache
python3 $T --bin $A funcs 'cli/backend/auth'     # regex over 171,928 function names
python3 $T --bin $A strs  '<exact func name>'    # string literals referenced by it
python3 $T --bin $A disas '<exact func name>'
python3 $T --bin $A grep  '<regex>'              # rodata scan
```

Recovered inventories live in [`data/`](data); captured live evidence in
[`evidence/`](evidence).

The large inventories (`funcs.txt`, `funcmap.json`, `pkgs.txt`, `tools/funcs.json`) are
**not committed** — they are regenerable in seconds and would add ~70 MB:

```bash
T=.project/analyses/antigravity-cli/1.4.8/tools/goresym.py
A=~/.local/bin/agy
python3 $T --bin $A funcs > data/funcs.txt          # 171,928 names + addresses
python3 $T --bin $A funcs | awk -F'\t' '{print $1,$3}' > data/funcmap.json  # if needed
```

### The three tools

| tool | purpose | contributed by |
|---|---|---|
| `goresym.py` | pclntab symbol recovery, alignment-independent string-literal and disassembly dumps | initial setup |
| `pbdump.py` | dump an embedded protobuf `FileDescriptorProto` from rodata, so message and field names/numbers are read from bytes rather than guessed | auth/quota pass |
| `xwalk.py` | cross-reference rodata strings to the functions that reference them | api pass |

`pbdump.py` is what makes field numbers in 04-api and 05-quota trustworthy: those tables
are decoded from the embedded descriptors, not inferred from accessor names.

## Method and its limits

No symbol table, no `.go.mod`, BOLT-reordered code. Names come from pclntab, addresses
from `0x6596000 + entryoff`, and string literals from alignment-independent RIP-relative
LEA scanning — because objdump alignment at a function entry is not trustworthy after
BOLT splitting (a fact several sections record explicitly when it bit them).

**Observed** means bytes, logs or live output. **Derived** means inferred from recovered
structure. **Unknown** is stated as unknown. No inference is presented as observation,
and §4 of [`08-integration-notes.md`](08-integration-notes.md) separates the two
explicitly.

`data/rpc_methods.txt` was first produced by regex over rodata and is contaminated; it was
regenerated from generated client/server method names and is now reliable (1,036
service/method pairs across 44 services).

## Deliberate restraint

The account owner's only constraint was not to get the account blocked. So: no repeated auth
attempts, no polling loop, and exactly **one** model turn — the cheapest offerable model, with a
prompt that cannot trigger a tool call. Everything else was the CLI's own startup traffic.
Read-only towards `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/` and `~/.config/antigravity/` (SQLite inspected
from copies).

Two method findings worth keeping:

1. **`agy -v=5` logs the outbound `User-Agent`, the full response header set and the full
   response body** (`http_helpers.go:369/375/381`), so the metadata wire format needs no proxy.
   Caveat: concurrent goroutines interleave those bodies mid-line and truncate payloads above
   roughly 15 KB, so re-read large ones through the endpoint.
2. **Request heads need a proxy, because the CLI logs only the UA.** A ~150-line Python
   TLS-terminating `CONNECT` proxy plus an `openssl` CA, with `HTTPS_PROXY` and `SSL_CERT_FILE`
   set for the child, exposed the whole outbound surface in one turn. Go honours both variables,
   and the loopback language-server hop is exempt from proxying, which keeps that boundary
   untouched.
